        <p>My dad is the strongest human being that I know. He works 40 hours every week, and has been for the past 30 years. He had a rare form of cancer, and managed to recover from it completely and get back to supporting our family. He also had hernia surgery, and now thyroid complications. Even with all of his extensive medical issues, he remains a hardworking individual who although has his problems, tries his best to be a good father and caretaker of our family. </p>
